# SYSTEM STRUCTURE  
### Layered Model of Terra, Axioma, and JAM

This document describes the structural relationship  
between the three components of the architecture.

It clarifies how they interact, why none of them replaces the others,  
and how they achieve full functionality only as a unified stack.

# LAYER 1: Terra (Community & Value Structure)

Terra defines:

- community behavior  
- resource usage  
- scarcity  
- distribution  
- quality  
- cooperative patterns  
- human value creation  

Terra is the community itself — translated into measurable,  
mathematically usable signals.

It is not imported as code.  
It *emerges* from people.

---

# LAYER 2: Axioma (Verification & Integrity)

Axioma receives Terra’s signals and checks:

- Are the values valid?  
- Are the constraints respected?  
- Are the models unchanged?  
- Is every step deterministic?  
- Is the output provably correct?  

Axioma acts as the integrity system of the entire architecture.

It transforms human-aligned values into mathematical truth conditions.

# LAYER 3: JAM (Execution Engine)

JAM carries the computational load.

It executes:

- proofs  
- models  
- simulations  
- calculations  
- deterministic workloads  
- large-scale processes  

JAM is the execution heart.  
It does not interpret values — it simply computes.

---

# Structural Relationship

```
Terra → provides values  
Axioma → proves correctness  
JAM → executes operations
```

None of these layers replaces another.  
They are structurally stacked, not hierarchically superior.

Terra is not “above” JAM in value.  
It is only above JAM in structure because JAM carries its computations.

---

# In Summary

- Terra = What the world is  
- Axioma = Whether it's true  
- JAM = What follows from it  

Together they form a complete societal computation engine.
