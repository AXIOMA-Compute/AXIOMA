# LAYER MODEL  
### Terra • Axioma • JAM  
### The Three-Layer Human-Aligned Compute Framework

This document defines the conceptual model of the layered architecture.

The layers do not compete.  
They complete one another.

# Layer Model Diagram

```
[ Layer 3 ]  Terra    →  Human Value Layer  
[ Layer 2 ]  Axioma   →  Verification Layer  
[ Layer 1 ]  JAM      →  Compute Layer
```

The numbering here reflects *structural dependency*,  
not value hierarchy.

# Layer 3: Terra (Human Value Layer)

Purpose:  
Provide dynamic, community-aligned values based on:

- scarcity  
- distribution  
- quality  
- real human behavior  
- collective growth  
- contribution  
- resource flow  

Terra adapts as humanity evolves.

# Layer 2: Axioma (Verification Layer)

Purpose:  
Transform Terra’s signals into mathematically verifiable constraints.

Functions:

- verify correctness  
- ensure deterministic execution  
- protect the system against manipulation  
- validate every step  
- produce proofs  
- enforce integrity  

Axioma is the mathematical shield of the ecosystem.

---

# Layer 1: JAM (Compute Layer)

Purpose:  
Execute everything that has been proven correct.

JAM:

- computes  
- scales  
- parallelizes  
- verifies execution  
- delivers deterministic results  
- acts as the engine for the entire system  

JAM is the computational heart.

# Full Interaction Flow

```
Terra  →  Axioma  →  JAM  →  Output
```

- Terra defines values.  
- Axioma proves them.  
- JAM computes based on them.  

This is the first system where human values,  
mathematical truth, and compute power  
are united in one consistent architecture.
