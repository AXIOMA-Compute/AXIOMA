# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW  
### Terra → Axioma → JAM  
### The Three-Layer Societal Compute Stack

This document provides a high-level overview of the complete architecture.  
The system consists of three independent but tightly connected layers:

- Terra (Human Value Layer)  
- Axioma (Mathematical Verification Layer)  
- JAM (Deterministic Compute Layer)

Together they form the world's first closed-loop societal computation system.

# 1. Terra Layer (Human Value Layer)

Terra represents the community itself.  
It is not just a technical module — it is the mathematical reflection  
of real human behavior, resource usage, cooperation,  
and the value people generate.

Terra provides:

- human-aligned values  
- scarcity and distribution metrics  
- quality and resource measurements  
- collective growth patterns  
- real-world signals  
- community-defined objectives  

These values are dynamic and adapt to human development.  
Terra defines *what is real*.

# 2. Axioma Layer (Mathematical Verification Layer)

Axioma transforms Terra’s real-world signals into  
rigorous mathematical constraints.

Axioma ensures:

- correctness of every operation  
- deterministic execution  
- immutability of models and parameters  
- verifiable proofs for every computation  
- zero manipulation or hidden behavior  
- alignment between human values and machine execution  

Axioma is the truth filter.  
Nothing passes without mathematical proof.

# 3. JAM Layer (Compute Engine Layer)

JAM is the deterministic supercompute engine that executes  
the verified computations at scale.

JAM provides:

- deterministic execution  
- verifiable compute  
- performance and parallelization  
- the ability to run large workloads securely  
- the foundation on which Axioma and Terra depend  

JAM is the heart of the system.  
Without JAM, the upper layers cannot operate.

# 4. How the System Works (Closed Loop)

```
TERRA  →  AXIOMA  →  JAM  
Real     Proven      Computed
Values   Truth       Results
```

- Terra defines reality.  
- Axioma proves correctness.  
- JAM performs the computation.  

This creates a complete, self-consistent,  
human-aligned societal compute system.
