# AXIOMA/Compute — Manifesto

## 1. Purpose

AXIOMA/Compute establishes a computational foundation where correctness, execution, and decision-making are governed by mathematics rather than trust, authority, or unverifiable processes.

The objective is clear:

Replace trust with proof.  
Replace opinion with determinism.  
Replace manipulation with mathematical integrity.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Mathematical Truth Over Interpretation  
AXIOMA enforces correctness through immutable constraints. Human bias or political influence cannot change truth.

### 2.2 Verifiable External Computation  
Any entity may compute, but only results proven correct may modify state. This ensures permissionlessness without sacrificing integrity.

### 2.3 Deterministic State Transitions  
All state changes must be provably correct and fully reproducible.

### 2.4 Transparency Without Exposure  
AXIOMA allows verifiable computation without revealing underlying data. Privacy and correctness coexist.

### 2.5 No Trusted Parties  
AXIOMA does not rely on trusted institutions, authorities, validators, corporations, or individuals.  
It relies solely on mathematics.

## 3. Structural Opposition

AXIOMA stands against:

- unverifiable decisions  
- opaque governance  
- black-box AI behavior  
- falsified research  
- economic data manipulation  
- unverifiable computation  
- structural corruption

## 4. Long-Term Vision

A world where:

- AI outputs are deterministic and provable  
- scientific work is reproducible  
- governance is transparent  
- economics are mathematically honest  
- global computation is verifiable  
- digital truth cannot be forged  

AXIOMA aims to form a foundational layer for verifiable global systems.

## 5. Call to Builders and Researchers

AXIOMA welcomes contributions from:

- cryptographers  
- protocol engineers  
- zero-knowledge researchers  
- AI safety experts  
- economists  
- governance architects  
- open-source contributors  

The protocol grows stronger as more minds engage with its constraints and proofs.

## 6. Commitment

AXIOMA commits to:

- mathematical integrity  
- verified computation  
- transparent evolution  
- open research  
- reproducible logic  
- quantum-secure cryptography  

Computation is only accepted when it becomes truth.
